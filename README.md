# Horse or Human Classification

This project involves creating an AI model to classify images as either containing a horse, a human, or neither. The model is implemented using TensorFlow, and a web application for uploading and classifying images is built using Flask. The web interface is designed with HTML and CSS to provide a user-friendly experience.

## Project Overview
